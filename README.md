# 🛒 Simple Sale System

**Simple Sale System** is a simple sales application built with a **Client–Server architecture**.  
It demonstrates clean separation of frontend and backend, handling requests, and building scalable software systems.  
Ideal for **portfolio projects** and showcasing software development skills.

---

## 📌 Project Goals

- Implement a simple sales management system
- Use Client–Server architecture
- Fully separate Backend and Frontend
- Provide an extendable foundation for future features

---

## 🧱 System Architecture

The project follows a **Client–Server model**:

- **Server (Backend)**  
  Handles business logic, data processing, and responds to client requests.

- **Client (Frontend)**  
  Interacts with the user, sends requests to the server, and displays results.

**Benefits of this architecture:**
- Scalability
- Easier maintenance
- Independent development of each layer
